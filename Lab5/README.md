1. Create a binary tree for a given simple arithmetic expression and find the prefix / postfix equivalent

2. Implement a dictionary of word-meaning pairs using binary search trees.

3. Find the shortest distance of every cell from a landmine inside a maze.

4. We have three containers whose sizes are 10 litres, 7 litres, and 4 litres, respectively. The 7-litre and 4-litre containers start out full of water, but the 10-litre container is initially empty. We are allowed one type of operation: pouring the contents of one container into another, stopping only when the source container is empty or the destination container is full. We want to know if there is a sequence of pourings that leaves exactly 2 litres in the 7 or 4-litre containers. Model this as a graph problem and solve.
